# WHAT DOES THE BOT DO?

If you are in a telegram that's not yours, and you want to forward messages from that group/channel to your telegram channel/discord channel, then you are in right place.
I am using the bot for forwarding crypto messages from a telegram group to mine using [tgcf](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf) and then from telegram to discord using [tedicross](https://github.com/TediCross).
This bot is then used for some automation i.e knowing when a crypto coin appears thrice in a row continually or discountinous manner for 15 seconds.
